LOGLINE
When the U.S. government attempts to activate the long-hidden Satoshi Bitcoin keys to trigger a global monetary reset, the keys fail—exposing a decade-old sabotage. As financial systems destabilize and rival nations mobilize, a hunted cryptographer races to uncover who really controls the world’s most powerful algorithmic asset before a silent war turns catastrophic.
PREMISE SUMMARY (200–250 words)
The world stands on the edge of a monetary tipping point. While BRICS nations accumulate gold preparing for a post-dollar world, a covert U.S. directorate plans a preemptive strike: reveal that America controls the original Satoshi wallets and launch the dollar’s transition to a Bitcoin-backed reserve hybrid. This “New Bretton Woods” would secure U.S. dominance for a century and devastate rival economies built around gold.
Inside a classified Treasury vault, the U.S. team attempts to activate the Satoshi keys—but the signature fails. Someone swapped the authorization years ago. Panic erupts.
Enter Elias Reed, a former NSA cryptographer turned academic, who accidentally discovers a buried anomaly in the early block timing that ties directly to the sabotage. Branded a traitor, hunted by U.S. black teams and foreign operatives, Elias is forced off-grid into a world of rogue coders, darknet markets, and AI-driven financial warfare.
Meanwhile, an unknown entity—possibly a dead researcher’s contingency, a splinter agency, or something non-human—activates a silent governance override on the network.
As nations scramble for the real keys, global markets spiral. A misstep could mean total collapse—or the birth of a new, uncontrolled, decentralized monetary order.
The final conflict will decide who—government, collective, or algorithm—controls the future of money.
THE HOOK
The Satoshi wallets move for the first time ever.
But not under U.S. control.
Someone—or something—got there first.
