## AI-Agentic Workflow Notes (Internal)

To accelerate development:

**Agent-01: Outline Engine**
Builds chapter-by-chapter outlines using the story bible.

**Agent-02: World Bible Maintainer**
Maintains canon: factions, tech, motivations, timeline.

**Agent-03: Character Depth Writer**
Expands motivations, arcs, internal conflicts.

**Agent-04: Scene Generator**
Produces draft scenes in consistent style for refinement.

**Agent-05: Continuity Checker**
Ensures foreshadowing, consistency, and tension rhythm align.

**Agent-06: Graphic Novel Visualizer**
Converts scenes to GN panels, mood, and composition notes.

**Agent-07: Marketing Strategist**
Drafts pitch decks, loglines, comps, and trailers.

This forms a modular, highly efficient pipeline.
