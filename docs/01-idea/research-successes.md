What the evidence says
Thriller fiction in general is alive and well.
For example, there was reporting that thriller sales in the UK rebounded after lockdown.

So the broader genre — espionage, conspiracy, global stakes — has demand.
Sub-niche (crypto/bitcoin/heist-finance) is small and fragmented.
We found plenty of titles in the “crypto thriller” space, but few major breakout successes.*
For instance, older cryptography-tech thrillers like Cryptonomicon (by Neal Stephenson) are well-known, but they weren’t marketed purely as “Bitcoin reserve-weapon” geopolitical novels and their success is more niche.

Also, self-publishing data shows that authors often make modest earnings unless they build a larger back-catalog and strong reader base.

Marketing and series momentum matter a lot.
One analysis noted that for thrillers, early books in a series saw big spikes, but later books or standalone titles struggled without strong marketing.

That suggests your launch and positioning will be critical.
High ceiling, but high competition and exposure required.
In general fiction you have many titles every year that don’t break out; only a few become “big” hits. The crypto-thriller niche is smaller, so the number of breakout successes is even fewer.
🧭 What this means for your project (and how to position for success)
Given that the market is not guaranteed, but also not closed, here are strategic implications:
Differentiation is key.
Your idea already has strong differentiators (monetary regime shift, state-level stakes, education-through-thriller). Lean into that.
Series potential matters.
Rather than a one-off, consider building this into a series (book 1: The Satoshi Coup, book 2: Gold War, book 3: Sovereign Chains) so you can build a reader base.
Strong marketing + hook + positioning.
Since you’re competing in a niche, the hook must be strong (“For readers of Dan Brown and Cryptonomicon, a bitcoin-based monetary war thriller”). Also, well-crafted cover, blurb, and marketing channels reaching crypto-interested readers plus thriller readers will help.
Hybrid value: entertainment + teaching.
Your educational threads (cryptography, decentralisation) add value that could make the book appeal beyond just thrillers — crypto-enthusiasts, tech readers, finance readers. That broadens your potential audience.
Adaptability for other formats (graphic novel, film/TV).
If you can show adaptation potential (graphic novel, streaming rights), you may enhance your chance of agent/publisher interest.
Manage expectations.
Given the niche, expecting a mega-hit on first book might be unrealistic — target solid niche success, build brand, then escalate.
✅ Verdict
So to answer your question:
Are they all winners? No.
Is it a dead-end market? No — there is opportunity.
Is it high risk / high reward? Absolutely.
If you execute well — strong concept, strong marketing, smart series planning, good writing — you have a viable shot of making this work. But you’ll also need to treat it as a project with long-term potential, not just a single novel hoping for a breakout.
