# Research - Modern Subcultures for Worldbuilding

Absolutely — Gibson's genius wasn't just predicting the future; it was embedding the future inside the present by grounding his worlds in **real subcultures, micro-tribes, scene aesthetics, and fringe behaviours** of his era.

For your project, the same technique will make the world feel:
- **lived-in**
- **credible**
- **textured**
- **contemporary**
- **emotionally authentic**
- **culturally anchored**

Below is a curated list of modern subcultures, proto-subcultures, and niche behaviours that would map perfectly into your cyber-geopolitical Spectacle-Bitcoin universe — especially with mild exaggeration or speculative extrapolation.

---

## 🌐 1. Contemporary Digital Subcultures (Obvious Fits)

These are deeply relevant to your themes and worldbuilding.

### ❖ Crypto-maximalist microtribes
- Bitcoin only
- Ordinals messianics
- Proof-of-Work purists
- Mining collectivists
- DeFi nihilists
- "Hard forks as theology" people
- Max pain theorists

**Use as:** hyper-specific characters who see the world through chainstate metaphors.

### ❖ OSINT Investigators
*(Online citizen-spy networks)*
- Telegram sleuths
- flight tracker crews
- tank-ID hobbyists
- open-source geolocation nerds
- conflict map communities

**Use as:** outsider truth-hunters who become plot catalysts.

### ❖ Techno-Occultists

The modern equivalent of cyberpunk mystics.

This is incredibly fertile:
- AI tarot
- memetic magic
- egregore forums
- Chaos Magick revivalists
- "synchromystic" YouTube analysts
- digital sigil practitioners
- Discord covens
- crypto-astrology hybrids
- quantum woo

**Use as:** the "Spectacle shamans" — people who treat mass media & blockchains as spiritual entities.

### ❖ InfoSec Underground

Genuine subculture with distinct aesthetics:
- DEF CON tribes
- hoodie/lockpick culture
- OPSEC flexing
- red team vs blue team rivalries
- novelty badges
- CTF (Capture the Flag) hackers
- RF hacking fetishists
- cryptopunks (actual ;) )

**Use as:** factions or advisers in your world.

### ❖ High-Frequency Trading Degens

Half-finance, half-goblin:
- caffeine-addicted quants
- millisecond-latency obsessives
- "adverse selectivity" cult talk
- Machine Learning monks
- Taleb wannabes
- Tokyo-London arbitrage nerds

**Use as:** the "markets as gods" perspective.

---

## 🎧 2. Music & Art Subcultures (Texture and Vibe)

### ❖ Synthwave / Cyberpunk Revival Kids
- neon aesthetics
- John Carpenter worship
- outrun
- retrofuturist fashion
- DIY analog synth building

**Use as:** the emotional soundtrack of a world losing itself to digital nostalgia.

### ❖ Sound System Culture 2020s edition

An evolution of Jamaican / UK rave energy but infused with:
- guerilla clubs
- AI DJ sets
- illegal underground VR parties
- glitch-hop mutations
- neurobass microgenres
- "light pollution minimalists"

**Use as:** subcultural pockets where truth leaks.

### ❖ Urban explorer / roof culture

Modern liminal explorers:
- drainers
- urbex crews
- abandoned mall photographers
- tunnel rats
- stealth artists

This gives noir vibes and physicality.

### ❖ Meme artists / Post-irony surrealists

Zuckerberg-inspired AI-weirdness:
- post-post-ironic meme labs
- "liminal corporate art"
- 3D-rendered uncanny mascot culture
- vaporwave corporatism
- glitch symbolists

**Use as:** the absurd shadow of the Spectacle.

---

## 📱 3. Social Microcultures (Very Real, Unsettlingly So)

### ❖ FinTok / HustleTok / Algorithm Bacchanal

The modern spectacle being born in real time:
- financial advice influencers
- absurd hustle bros
- spiritual crypto gurus
- "I made $50k in 24 hours" charlatans

**Perfect for collapse sequences.**

### ❖ Parasocial Micro-Cults

Influencers who function like prophets:
- wellness seers
- productivity saints
- "sovereignty coaches"
- crypto monks
- anti-establishment gurus

**A goldmine for narrative tension.**

### ❖ NPC Livestreamers

This subculture is so surreal it feels posthuman:
- TikTok NPC streamers
- microworld ASMR broadcasters
- live-loop persona actors

**Perfect commentary on the Spectacle.**

### ❖ Anti-Consumer Consumerists

Minimalist maximalists:
- anti-brand brand culture
- normcore
- "nothingcore"
- performative simplicity

**Can be woven as ideological contrast.**

---

## ⚙️ 4. Political & Ideological Microtribes

### ❖ Post-left accelerationists

Hyper-niche and philosophically rich:
- pro-collapse theorists
- meme-based political cells
- eco-nihilists
- psycho-cybernetics enthusiasts

**Good for introducing intellectual pressure points.**

### ❖ Prepper Tech-Elites

Silicon Valley apocalypse fetishists:
- buying NZ bunkers
- building sovereign compounds
- longtermist cultists
- OpenAI doomerists
- biohackers experimenting on themselves

**Very compatible with your themes.**

### ❖ Parallel Economy Evangelists

Decentralisation as lifestyle:
- crypto homesteaders
- privacy maximalists
- mesh network idealists
- "sovereign stacks" proponents

**Perfect for alternative-faction worldbuilding.**

---

## 🕹️ 5. Emerging Subcultures Only Visible on the Edges

These feel Gibsonian because they're just becoming real.

### ❖ Prompt Artists
People who treat AI image generation as legitimate art.

### ❖ Algorithm Surfers
People who chase trending waves like digital nomads:
- Spotify AI-audience farmers
- Midjourney style-chasers
- TikTok algorithm apprentices

### ❖ Virtual Land Prospectors
NFT metaverse speculators before the bubble crashed — now weird and fringe again.

### ❖ LLM Whisperers
People who talk to AI like spirits.

## 🧬 6. How to Weave These Into the Novel (Gibson-style)

Gibson never paused exposition. He:
- referenced subcultures casually
- implied knowledge
- expected readers to catch up
- used slang as texture
- allowed mystery to stand

### Your equivalent:

- Elias passes through a **mining commune** using ex-military generators
- a **Spectacle influencer** becomes a villain
- a **Chaos Magick Discord** leaks the truth early
- a **DeFi nihilist** shows Elias how little anyone controls
- **urbex explorers** guide him through a physical labyrinth of abandoned agency data centres
- a **prompt artist** fakes intel that looks real
- **NPC streamers** parody the crisis live
- a **quant** explains the world with unhinged metaphors
- **post-ironic meme artists** turn the catastrophe into surreal humour

### The trick:
**never explain their culture — let it exist in-scene.**

## 🎯 Next Steps Available

If you want, next I can:
- Build a **subculture integration map** (which ones belong to which factions)
- Draft **sample scenes** using three subcultures at once
- Create a **lexicon** (Gibson-style slang, metaphors, tribal dialects)
- Outline how these **subcultures influence the plot loops**
