# Next Steps - Format Development Options

## Serialization Options

If you want, next we can build:
- a serialisable prequel arc list
- a release strategy
- a content cadence plan
- a reader community plan
- a Substack or Vella starter packet

## Audio Drama Development

🎯 If you want, next I can build:
- a pilot episode outline
- a full season arc
- a character list optimised for audio
- a sound design bible (Carpenter-style motifs)
- a pitch deck for Audible Originals / Spotify / QCode

## Experimental Novel Format

Would you like me to:
- Build a sample chapter sequence mixing narrative + inserts?
- Create a visual Spectacle style guide for motif pages?
- Draft a prototype Spectacle insert?
- Create a full structural blueprint for the hybrid novel?

## Interactive Fiction Development

I can build:
- ✔️ A full interactive outline (like Fighting Fantasy's "map")
- ✔️ A sample branching scene
- ✔️ Stat + inventory system tuned to your themes
- ✔️ A Spectacle Maze structural diagram
- ✔️ A modern interactive-book blurred-format hybrid
- ✔️ A demo "turn-to-X" section with tone + puzzle

## Web-World Development

I can now build:
- ✔️ a sitemap for the Web-World
- ✔️ a visual aesthetic guide (colours, glitch style, typography)
- ✔️ user-flow diagrams (Spectacle Maze, Lore Layers)
- ✔️ sample pages (with text, layout, content)
- ✔️ a style guide for the media-noise zone
- ✔️ puzzle concepts and crypto-lite riddles
- ✔️ a branching narrative prototype
- ✔️ a full production plan
- ✔️ a conceptual pitch deck
