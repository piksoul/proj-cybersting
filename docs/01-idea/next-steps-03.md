If you want, next we can build:
a serialisable prequel arc list
a release strategy
a content cadence plan
a reader community plan
a Substack or Vella starter packet


🎯 If you want, next I can build:
a pilot episode outline
a full season arc
a character list optimised for audio
a sound design bible (Carpenter-style motifs)
a pitch deck for Audible Originals / Spotify / QCode


Would you like me to:
Build a sample chapter sequence mixing narrative + inserts?
Create a visual Spectacle style guide for motif pages?
Draft a prototype Spectacle insert?
Create a full structural blueprint for the hybrid novel?


I can build:
✔️ A full interactive outline (like Fighting Fantasy’s “map”)
✔️ A sample branching scene
✔️ Stat + inventory system tuned to your themes
✔️ A Spectacle Maze structural diagram
✔️ A modern interactive-book blurred-format hybrid
✔️ A demo “turn-to-X” section with tone + puzzle



I can now build:
✔️ a sitemap for the Web-World
✔️ a visual aesthetic guide (colours, glitch style, typography)
✔️ user-flow diagrams (Spectacle Maze, Lore Layers)
✔️ sample pages (with text, layout, content)
✔️ a style guide for the media-noise zone
✔️ puzzle concepts and crypto-lite riddles
✔️ a branching narrative prototype
✔️ a full production plan
✔️ a conceptual pitch deck
