# Next Steps - Creative Development Options (Round 4)

I can write:
🚨 The reveal scene from the villain's POV
💥 A rooftop extraction sequence when the protagonist is blamed
🧠 A flashback explaining when/how the keys were swapped
🌐 A cyberpunk "on-chain anomaly" scene showing real-time blockchain manipulation
📜 A short fictional prologue from Satoshi's journal
🎞️ A teaser trailer narration
🧩 Character sheets and arcs
🗺️ Story outline (Acts 1–3)
🛠️ The worldbuilding bible (tech, geopolitics, slang, factions)



Build the main characters
Flesh out the antagonist(s)
Create chapter outlines
Create the geopolitical backdrop
Write teaser scenes (opening chase / on-chain anomaly / Satoshi wallets moving)
Build world lore (tech, AI agents, darknet markets, secret protocols)
