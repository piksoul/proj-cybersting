# Research - Global Locations for Story Setting

Below is a curated list of high-impact, tonally perfect, thematically aligned locations for your story. These aren't just cool backdrops; each one meaningfully reinforces:
- decentralisation
- surveillance vs autonomy
- subculture vibrancy
- geopolitical tension
- network emergence
- Spectacle overload
- cryptographic symbolism
- thriller atmosphere

I've grouped them into functional categories so you can easily map them to scenes.

## HOW THESE EASTERN EUROPE LOCATIONS FIT YOUR STORY STRUCTURALLY

### Act II: The Fracture World Tour

As Elias flees and factions mobilise:
- **Prague** → early contacts, Kafkaesque paranoia
- **Krakow** → intel extraction & historical memory
- **Budapest** → hidden meeting + bathhouse revelation
- **Split/Dubrovnik** → safehouse under pressure
- **Istanbul** → art scene + philosophical turns
- **Lake Bled / Ljubljana** → interlude with metaphysical undertones

These cities create a European middle-act labyrinth that feels:
- alive
- poetic
- gritty
- dripping with history
- aesthetically rich

They also work beautifully for the Spectacle Inserts.
