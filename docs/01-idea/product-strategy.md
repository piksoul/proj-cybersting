IDEAS FOR NOVEL + GRAPHIC NOVEL STRATEGY
Here’s how to execute both formats strategically without doubling work.
A. Novel Strategy (Long-form, 90k–110k words)
Focus on:
1. Atmosphere
Clancy precision + Bourne pacing + Gibson cyberpunk textures.
Lean into cities at night, code as myth, high-tech claustrophobia.
2. Conspiracy Layering
Gradually peel back:
hidden NSA research
Satoshi sabotage
U.S. BTC regime plans
rogue AI signatures
geopolitical shuffling
Each revelation pushes the thriller upward.
3. Action Set Pieces
Zurich crypto-vault raid
Shanghai data-harbour infiltration
CIA extraction from a drone-saturated airport
Digital heist: stealing part of a Shamir-share from a biometric vault
Chase through a neon surveillance zone
These anchor chapters.
4. Moral Ambiguity
No side is fully good
Decentralization isn’t pure
Centralization isn’t pure
Elias is caught between systems
This keeps it adult and modern.
B. Graphic Novel Strategy (Abbreviated, 120–180 pages)
You can convert the novel into a visual companion without retelling every beat.
How the graphic novel differs:
1. Focus on the most cinematic scenes
Use only:
The vault signature failure
The Zurich raid
The rogue node reveal
The floating data-haven
The final confrontation
This creates a high-density experience.
2. Use visual metaphors heavily
Blockchain visualized as:
neon state channels
fractal decision trees
cryptographic ghosts
ghostly Satoshi silhouettes
3. Less dialogue, more atmosphere
Narration boxes can replace entire conversations.
Let the art carry emotion.
4. Serialized future potential
Could expand into:
The Saboteur’s backstory
Early NSA crypto experiments
A sequel about the AI entity gaining autonomy
C. Strategy for Both
Write the novel first for universe depth
Choose top 5–7 set pieces for the graphic novel
Possibly develop the GN as a pitch product for agents/publishers/film
