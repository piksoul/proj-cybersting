Want me to turn the Chapter Tree into
👉 a detailed chapter-by-chapter outline?
B) Want character sheets for:
The Protagonist
The Saboteur (the anti-hero)
The U.S. shadow operators
The foreign intelligence rivals
The AI entity
C) Want me to write the opening first 1–3 chapters in cinematic prose?
D) Or build a full world bible (technology, geopolitics, slang, factions)?



Expand the chapter tree into a 20–30 page full outline
Build the character bible
Start drafting the opening chapter
Create a graphic novel visual style guide




If you want, next step I can do:
A style fusion guide (how to blend these influences without clashing)
A reader demographic profile
A comp title list for query letters
A tone bible for your novel



Create a tone bible melding Clancy + Gibson + these films
▶️ Build character archetypes inspired by them
▶️ Write the opening scene using these combined stylistic influences
