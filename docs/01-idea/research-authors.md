# Research - Author Influences

## 🎯 1. Tom Clancy — The Blueprint for Techno-Thrillers

### Style
- Hyper-detailed technical realism (weapons, intelligence, geopolitics).
- Expansive worldbuilding tied to real agencies (CIA, NSA, military).
- Multiple POVs (presidents, analysts, field operators).
- Stakes: national security, global conflicts, deep-state manoeuvring.

### Success Factors
- Felt "insider" even when fictional.
- Tapped Cold War anxieties perfectly.
- Books became franchises (Jack Ryan).
- Readers trust Clancy's depiction of systems.

### Relevance to Your Story

Your novel shares:
- state-level stakes
- agency turf wars
- geopolitical financial warfare
- technical realism (cryptography, mining, cyber ops)

But differs by:
- leaning more cyberpunk
- including cryptographic + AI mystery
- teaching decentralisation concepts
- using speculative future macroeconomics

**Clancy gives you your structure and realism backbone.**

## 🎯 2. Dan Brown — The Modern, Fast-Paced Conspiracy Thriller

### Style
- Short chapters (2–6 pages).
- Cliffhanger chapter endings.
- Puzzles + codes + historical secrets.
- Main character = "interpreter of symbols / systems".
- Villains often ideological.

### Success Factors
- Page-turning structure.
- High accessibility: minimal technical jargon.
- Thrills wrapped in familiar institutions (Vatican, Smithsonian).
- Clear, digestible "learning moments".

### Relevance to Your Story

You can borrow:
- pacing
- cliffhanger structure
- deciphering digital clues
- an "everyman intellectual" protagonist (Elias)
- high-concept MacGuffin (Satoshi keys)

Your book differs by being:
- more grounded
- darker
- much more technical (but in a disguised, digestible way)

**Brown gives you your reader accessibility + pacing engine.**

## 🎯 3. William Gibson — The Vibe, The Texture, The Cultural DNA

### Style
- Cyberpunk aesthetics
- Descriptions that feel like "visual poetry"
- Tech as culture, not tool
- Emergence, chaos, decentralised power
- Marginal characters caught in big systems

### Success Factors
- Invented the modern vision of cyberspace.
- Captured globalisation, networks, and corporate power before others.
- Deeply atmospheric, sensory-rich writing.

### Relevance to Your Story

Your book directly benefits from:
- sensory cyberpunk backdrops (darknets, data havens, neon surveillance cities)
- philosophical tech undertones (AI emergent behaviour, sovereignty, decentralised order)
- sense of inevitability and paranoia

**Gibson gives you tone + style + mythic cyber atmosphere.**

## 🎯 4. Neal Stephenson — The High-IQ Techno-Epic

### Style
- Big ideas, complex systems
- Long form, deep exposition
- Cryptography, math, digital currencies
- Multigenerational plots
- Near-future + speculative tech
- Lots of "idea density"

### Success Factors
- Commands respect from tech professionals & crypto community
- His novel Cryptonomicon is practically proto-Bitcoin
- Defined "serious" cyber-thriller intelligence
- Geek credibility + mainstream reach

### Relevance to Your Story

Stephenson is basically the godfather of:
- cryptography fiction
- digital money-as-plot
- underground information networks

Your book should borrow:
- intellectual seriousness
- grounded explanations of cryptographic principles
- the sense that "there is a hidden system beneath the world"

**Stephenson gives you intellectual depth + cryptographic DNA.**

## 🎯 5. Michael Crichton — The Science-Driven Thriller

### Style
- Hyper-researched scientific premise
- "What if this tech went wrong?"
- Crisis escalation
- Governments and corporations scrambling
- Tight pacing + mainstream accessibility
- Danger emergent from misunderstood technologies

### Success Factors
- Clear, direct prose
- Heavy science, wrapped in drama
- Mass-market appeal
- His books consistently became films

### Relevance to Your Story

Your novel echoes:
- technology as existential risk
- "crisis of understanding"
- the collision of science and politics

**Crichton gives you mass accessibility + techno-crisis narrative power.**

## 🎯 6. John le Carré — The Grey-Zone Spycraft Tone

### Style
- Slow-burn intelligence intrigue
- Moral ambiguity
- Quiet betrayals
- Intelligence bureaucracies
- Broken, haunted protagonists

### Success Factors
- Real-world intelligence nuance
- Emotional depth
- High literary credibility

### Relevance

Useful if you want:
- deeper character interiority
- moral greyness in agencies
- subtle betrayals
- slow tension

**Le Carré gives you moral ambiguity + emotional realism.**
