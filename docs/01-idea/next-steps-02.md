# Next Steps - Additional Development Paths

## Research & Style Development

If you'd like, next I can:

- Build a research plan (what to read first, how to use it)
- Highlight tropes to borrow vs tropes to avoid
- Create a style fusion guide from these influences
- Begin drafting prose in one of these fused styles

## Philosophical Themes Integration

Want me to synthesize this into a "Philosophical Themes Bible" for your novel?
Or map each theme directly onto specific chapters/scenes?

## Safety & Worldbuilding

- A "Safe Writing Guidelines" page for your story bible
- A fictional agencies roster to replace CIA/NSA/FSB/etc with flavour
- A fictional geopolitical map to reduce real-world exposure
- A fictional megacorp list for crypto, mining, and finance players

## Satoshi Origin Development

Want me to outline the 3–4 possible Satoshi origin arcs?
So you can pick the one that fits the novel's tone?

## Digital Mysticism & Mythology

- Sketch three possible "digital mysticism" subcultures for your world
- Create the emergent-AI behaviour patterns that feel meaningful
- Build a spiritual-philosophical antagonist
- Draft the Satoshi mythology bible that characters whisper about

## Debord & Spectacle Integration

Next Steps (choose one):

- Want me to write a "Debord x Cyberpunk x Blockchain" thematic bible for your story?
- Build a Satoshi Mythology Framework using these ideas?
- Create characters influenced by art movements / Theory / Situationist ideas?
- Develop the "Spectacle as emergent intelligence" arc?

Pick the direction — I'll build it.

## Core Development Priorities

- Build a Character Architecture (Elias + Saboteur + Factions)?
- Flesh out Act II's mid-point twist + major reversal?
- Create the Bitcoin Mythology / Spectacle framework?
- Produce a visual style + tone bible?
